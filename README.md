# rat music
Commandline music player I'm making in order to learn Rust. Uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) for audio playback and [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) for the TUI. Work in progress, please be patient. You can find the key bindings below, they are being regularly updated as I develop the program.

# Key bindings
| Key | Function |
| --- | --- |
| q | Quits. |
| p | Opens the dialog for selecting a song. Might not focus the dialog window. |
| s | Skips current track. |
| ↑ | Raises volume by 0.1 |
| ↓ | Lowers volume by 0.1 |
| h | Speeds up playback by 0.1 |
| j | Slows down playback by 0.1 |
